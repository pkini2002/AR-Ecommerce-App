## Problem Statement

The problem statement for this AR e-commerce app project is to provide an immersive
and interactive shopping experience to the users. Traditional e-commerce platforms offer
limited product visualization, which makes it difficult for customers to make an informed
purchase decision. With the implementation of Augmented Reality (AR), customers can
view 3D models of the products in real-time and make informed decisions about their
purchases.

The AR e-commerce app aims to solve the following problems:

- Limited product visualization: Traditional e-commerce platforms offer limited product visualization, which can result in a higher number of returns and unsatisfied customers.
- Inconvenient size and fit: Online shopping makes it difficult for customers to determine the perfect size and fit for their desired product. This leads to a higher number of returns and unsatisfied customers
-  Lack of interactivity: Traditional e-commerce platforms lack interactivity, whichcan lead to a monotonous shopping experience.

## TechStack Used

- `Java` 
- `XML Design (Frontend)`
- `Firebase database (Realtimedb, Cloud Storage and Authentication db)`
- `Augmented reality SDK's`
